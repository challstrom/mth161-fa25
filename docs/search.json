Looking at a package’s vingnette is a good way to learn the names of the datasets included in a package.",

Similarly, I don’t check my email often much on weekends. I will do my best to respond as soon as I am able.\n\n\nOffice\nBuckley Center 270. My office is on the second floor of the NW wing of Buckley Center (BC). While I do have specific times set aside for drop-in hours (see below), you are always welcome to stop by at anytime!\n\n\nWebpage\nAll course materials will be posted on our class Moodle page. I will regularly post a summary of our class activities so if you ever miss class for any reason, you can check here to see what you missed.\n\n\nTextbook\nReadings for the course will come from the following textbook which is freely available online. You do not need to purchase a physical copy of the book to succeed in this class.\n[ims]: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Jo Hardin. Introduction to Modern Statistics. 2nd edition. OpenIntro, 2024.\nHere is another free resource you may find helpful.\n[r4ds]: Hadley Wickham,Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. R for Data Science. 2nd edition.\n\n\nTechnology\nIn this course, we will make use of the R programming language for data analysis and visualization and analysis. We’ll access R via web platform Posit Cloud. You will need a posit cloud student account to access course materials. Note that there is a small fee ($5 per month) for this subscription.\n\n\nCollaboration\nUnless otherwise instructed, I encourage you to work together with classmates on class assignments, although any work that you hand in (unless it’s a group assignment) should be your own.\n\n\nOnline resources (including AI)\nI am well aware that a huge volume of R code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Since the focus of this course is not learning R, but rather interpreting the results of statistical analysis you may - unless explicitly told otherwise - make use of any online resources to obtain R code. You do need to explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or are inspired by.\nYou should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. Again, if you do use AI tools for help in coding, you must explicity cite this.\nUnless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments or to assist in answering exercises or homework problems. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the posted due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances or by prior arrangement, I will not accept work after those dates.\n\n\nImportant dates\n\nTuesday, August 27: Classes begin\nFriday, August 30: Last day to add/drop\nFriday, October 13: First hard deadline, Project 1 due\nMonday, October 15: Fall Break begins\nMonday, November 25: Last day to Withdraw\nThursday, November 28: Thanksgiving\nFriday, December 6: Last day of classes; 2nd hard deadline, Project 2 due\nMonday, December 9: Section H check-in, 10:30-12:30\nWednesday, December 11: Section I check-in, 1:30-3:30.",

    "text": "It is my experience that much of your learning in this course will occur outside of class. You might get stuck on a homework problem or lab exercise or perhaps have a question from class that did not get fully resolved. It is also my experience that significant learning occurs when you are talking through the material with another person. Finally, it’s important to remember that mathematics is a cumulative subject where material builds upon prior knowledge; once you get behind it is very hard to catch up.\nFor these reasons among others, I strongly encourage you to reach out at any time with any question. In addition to emailing me, or stopping by my office, here are some other ways to get help.\n\nDrop-In Student Hours\nI have set aside the times listed below during which I am available for drop-in help. You do not need to let me know you’re coming – just stop by my office (BC 270). Many students find these drop-in hours can be particularly helpful if you are working together with classmates. You can work together at one of the tables down the hall from my office and just pop in when you have any questions.\n\nTuesday 3-4\nWednesday 10-12\nThursday 2-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote – if my schedule changes at any point, I may need to adjust these times. I will post any changes on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign-Up Hours\nI recognize that your schedule might not allow you to stop by during the posted drop-in hours. Or you simply might find it more convenient to meet with me at a different time. If you go to my Calendly scheduler, you can sign-up for a time slot to meet, either in person or via zoom. If there is a specific time that you would like to meet and you don’t see it available on the Calendly scheduler, please reach out to me via email.\n\n\nOpen Door\nI have the scheduled drop-in hours simply to give you some times when you know that I’ll be available – but you are always welcome to stop by my office at any time. Unless I’m in class or in a meeting, I will generally be available to meet with you.\n\n\nMath Resource Center\nThe MRC offers both drop-in tutoring as well as scheduled, individualized help. I will post the MRC schedule on Moodle as soon as it becomes available (usually the second week of the semester). Note: the mth 161 tutors in the MRC will likely not be able to help with R questions.",

    "text": "This course aims to introduce you to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. We will consider why in 1950, S. Wilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.”\nWe will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. We will acquire a conceptual understanding and proficiency in statistical and quantitative reasoning tools to help you critique and evaluate data-based claims and decisions.\nIn addition, students are presented with novel data sets and application examples on a daily basis, and they use these data to model outcomes and make inferences about unknown population characteristics. Students learn that the first step of any analysis is identifying the assumptions and conditions necessary to apply the statistical technique(s) required to answer the research question at hand. Students not only learn the mechanics of the quantitative analysis, but also how to interpret conclusions based on quantitative evidence in context of the data and the research questions as well as identifying limitations due to data collection and study design.",

Worse than that, research shows that grades undermine the learning process in several ways:\nUnfortunately, I am required to submit a grade for each student at the end of the semester – but I will do what I can to de-emphasize the role of grades in this course so that as much as possible our focus is on learning.",

You might find them helpful as well.\n\nA\n\nThis grade generally indicates superior work that demonstrates a deep understanding of the material such that you could apply the material in unfamiliar or especially complex situations. You should should consistently demonstrate this deep understanding of the material using a wide variety of methods described above. This grade likely includes:\n\n\n\ndemonstrating significant course engagement, including homework, as evidenced in weekly engagement reports and AEs\nsuccessfully completing all lab assignments\nsuccessfully completing both projects\n\n\nB\n\nThis grade indicates good work that is eminently satisfactory. You should be able to use and extend this knowledge in many situations although you might have difficulty with particularly challenging or unfamilar problems. You should consistently demonstrate your understanding of the material using some of the methods described above. This grade likely includes\n\n\n\ndemonstrating many elements of course engagement as evidenced in weekly engagement reports and AEs\ncompleting most lab assignments\ncompleting both projects\n\n\nC\n\nThis grade indicates competent work that demonstrates an basic understanding of the course material. You should be able to handle most of the more straightforward problems encountered but might struggle with more challenging problems. You might consistently meet only a few of the criteria listed above or else meet several criteria but less often. This grade likely includes\n\n\n\ndemonstrating some elements of course engagement as evidence in weekly engagement reports and AEs\ncompleting some lab assignments\nattempting at least one project\n\n\nD/F\n\nThese grades represent a fundamental breakdown of expectations. A D represents a meaningful but unsuccessful attempt at earning a C or above. An F represents such a severe lack of engagement, effort, or understanding that there is no evidence of meaningful progress.\n\n+/-\n\nIn discussing your course grade together, we may opt to add a modifier to your grade.\n\n\n\nA \\(\\mathbf{-}\\) modifier might be added to your grade if you’ve met the standards for a particular grade with the exception of one element (engagement, labs, or projects e.g.)\nA \\(\\mathbf{+}\\) modifier might be added to your grade if you’ve met the standards for a particular grade and you’ve met one of the elements for a higher grade.",
