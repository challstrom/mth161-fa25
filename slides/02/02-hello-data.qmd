ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Species",
    shape = "Species",
    caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package"
  ) +

```

## Narrative

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.

Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color and shape of each point.

Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", and add a caption for the data source.

Finally, use a discrete color scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.
